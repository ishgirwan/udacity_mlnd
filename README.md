# Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree

The projects of this program helps in learning to:
* Test Python code and build a Python package      
* Build predictive models using a variety of unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques.       
* Use Amazon SageMaker to deploy machine learning models to production environments.      
* A/B test two different deployed models and evaluate their performance.       
* Utilize an API to deploy a model to a website such that it responds to user input, dynamically.       
* Update a deployed model, in response to changes in the underlying data source.
